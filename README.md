# Image-Classification-Models
# **This repository contains the initial models for garbage classification trained on Trashnet's dataset.**
### How to download and use the models?
It is recommended that you download the `ipynb` files and use the models in Google Colab as the models may require high computational power to run. If you want to run the models in your local environment, then checkout the setup requirements from the [home page](https://github.com/DumpIt-Right/DumpIt-Right) of our repo.

For more information on the models, checkout [Efficient-net](https://github.com/Jai132/DumpIt-2.0/tree/main/initial_test_models/efficient_net_model) and [YOLO V8](https://github.com/Jai132/DumpIt-2.0/tree/main/initial_test_models/ultralytics_yolov8_model)
