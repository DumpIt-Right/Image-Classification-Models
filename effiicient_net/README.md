# Efficient-net
Efficient-net is a neural network architecture. It's designed to process and understand images. When we want a model to understand images, we use neural networks. But making these networks efficient for both accuracy and speed can be a challenge. Efficient-Net solves this challenge by finding the right balance between the size of the neural network and its performance. Efficient-Net finds the best size for the neural network based on the complexity of the images it's dealing with. If the images are simple, it uses a smaller network. If the images are more complex, it switches to a larger network. This way, Efficient-net can handle a wide range of images while being fast and accurate, making it a great tool for tasks like classifying objects in pictures as we show in our model.

Apart from Efficient-net, we used Tensorflow to train the model on Trashnet's [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/feyzazkefe/trashnet) by Feyza Ozkefe

This model could not have been possible without [Himanshu's](https://github.com/nerdlab53) help. Check out his Kaggle [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/himanshubhenwal)
